- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @forkiesassds
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord (icanttellyou), please note that I may not accept your friend request if you haven't discussed prior. I have no idea why Discord still hasn't implemented a feature where people without any mutual servers and are not friends instead go to message requests.

I have no clue what to put here.
